<a href="https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor">Reactor</a> - The framework used by this API.                                                       

# Usage
Download the latest <a href="https://github.com/SteamUnlocked21/ReactorAPI/releases/latest">release</a> and place it in 'YourAmongUsDirectory\BepInEx\plugins\' along with Reactor.
